# ansible-config-mgt
#This is to manage automation of configuration management using ansible and a Bastion host.
#This line is to verify the copy_saveartifacts pipe line created. So if this update is available in the README.md file store in the Jenkins server then the pipeline is successfull after the ansible project build.
#cat home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact/README.md thankyou
